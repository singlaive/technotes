###Why do I build my blog on Git pages?
Ah, because Github does not charge me a penny for its highly reliable service, and no ads, full stop. If you ever tried to find out a free or cheap hosting service provider, you will definitely know what I mean.

Secondly, it feels geeky. I am not a nerd (believe you are not either), but geek is not bad.

###Why do I use Jekyll? Hang on, what is it? What is the funny 'll' from?
You don't have to, really. You can just create some html (like index.html etc.) and Github will manage it pretty well. But Jekyll is the official tool Github uses to parse your articles. And it is hassel so free, so why not.

Truely no idea why jekyll is spelled like this, not by me. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) is a text transformation engine. Not a sensible wording for you? Fine, it builds blog for you, as an alternate tool of [Word Press](https://wordpress.org/).

 - It is simple (quite light wight) to use. Like what it says, "make it work in 3sec"
 - Your blog it builds responses extremely fast. Coz it renders static files only, no JS, nothing to slow it down.
 - Free to use, supporting all popular platform *unix, Mac, Windows (not officially though) etc.

###How long I need to build up an awesome look website/bog, 2hours?

Depending on how you want to play with it. If you just follow the instructions below blindly not bothering knowing details, probably after 10min you will have your site running (see how easy it is!). But if you want to know what you installed, why you type commands like that, and how you can customise the site for yourself, you need a bit more effort.

This tutorial expects you

 - Have both hands (or one finger...) which can type Linux commands.
 - Knows a little bit about git, like `git add` or `git commit`. That is almost sufficient! :) If serieouly you don't know much, no worry, I will explain to  you.
 - Heard about the funny words like Markdown, HTML, Ruby, etc. You don't really need to be expert about them.

Here we go.

Hang on, have you got a login on github yet? No? [Do it now](https://github.com/)! It might cost you 3min.
