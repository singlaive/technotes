#BDD

##What is BDD
- Behavior-Driven Development, or BDD is an Agile software technique that encourages collaboration between developers and non-technical or business participants in a software project
- BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behavior hrough discussion with stakeholders to include acceptance test driven development
- It extends TDD by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read.

##Aim of BDD
- BDD relies on the use of very specific vocabulary to minimize miscommunication and to ensure that everyone (i.e. business, developers, testers, analysts and managers) is not only on the same page but also using the same words
- BDD is to bring together existing, well-established techniques under a common banner with consistent and unambiguous teminology

##How to perform PDD in Agile?
- A user story's behavior can e defined by acceptance criteria. In this pattern
 - Given some initial context,
 - When an event occurs,
 - then ensure an outcome

##Cucumber and Gherkin
- BDD framework written by Ruby, usable on multiple programming language
- Cucumber executes plain text as automated tests
- Tests written in business facing text
- The test is written in Gherkin
- Interacts with the target language.
