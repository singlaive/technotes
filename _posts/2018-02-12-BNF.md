Recently I read about stomp protocol, a concise asynchronise messaging solution between client and server. It defines its syntax in BNF, Backus-Naur Form. What is it?

BNF is a framework of grammars used to provide precise definitions. It is said to be 'context-free'. I would say 'self-descriptive'. This form is widely nowadays to describes techinique standard, programming languages and software manual. Take a quick look at what it is:

* Anything within "" is a literal string
* Anything outside "" is the description
* <> indicates mandatory
* [] indicates optional
* {} indicates repeating of zero or infinate times
* | is OR

A simple question is a defination for MIME:
version := "MIME-Version" ":" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

In English: a version of MIME is defined as MIME-Version followed by a colon followed by one digit with a dot followed by another one digit. In this definition "MIME-Version:1.2" is correct, whilst "MIME-VERSION:1.00" is not. The reason is not about the upper case of VERSION, but the number part of 1.00. The literal string surranded by "" is case insensitive. There is syntax to descrive case sensitive string, which is out of the scope here.
